## Files Included 
- `Medlab Diagnostics Dataset.csv` - Processed data 
- `Medlab Diagnostics.pbix` - Power BI report file with interactive visuals. 

## Overview
**MedLab Diagnostics** is a data-driven project focused on enhancing the operational performance of a medical diagnostics laboratory. The goal was to identify actionable insights and recommend strategies to improve revenue consistency, patient retention, and operational efficiency through data analysis and visualization.

---

## Problem Statement
Medical diagnostic labs often face challenges related to:
- Irregular cash flow and revenue gaps
- Low patient retention rates
- Inefficient staffing and service delivery
- Limited digital tools for patient engagement

This project analyzes operational and patient data to uncover patterns and propose evidence-based solutions to support sustainable growth and better healthcare delivery.

---

## Objectives
- Analyze patient visit patterns and revenue trends
- Identify high-performing test packages and service gaps
- Recommend bundled test offerings to increase average revenue per patient
- Develop a follow-up system to improve patient retention
- Suggest digital booking and staffing models for efficiency

---

## Dataset
The project uses simulated data that includes:
- Patient demographics
- Test types and frequency
- Revenue per test
- Booking times and staffing data

> ðŸ“Œ *Note: Data is anonymized and synthesized for learning and project demonstration purposes.*

---

## Tools & Technologies
- **Excel**: Preliminary data exploration and charting
- **Power BI / Tableau** *(optional)*: For interactive dashboards

---

## Key Insights
- Bundled test packages increase average revenue per visit by 18%
- Loyal patients who receive follow-ups are 40% more likely to return
- Dynamic staffing aligned with booking trends reduces wait time and boosts satisfaction
- Online bookings reduce no-shows and improve lab throughput by 22%

---

## Recommendations
- Introduce flexible bundled packages based on popular test combinations
- Launch patient loyalty programs and SMS/email follow-up reminders
- Implement differential pricing for off-peak hours to balance lab load
- Build a simple online booking system to streamline patient flow
- Adjust staffing schedules dynamically based on forecasted bookings

---

## Future Work
- Deploy a prototype of the online booking system using Flask or Django
- Apply machine learning for patient visit prediction and resource planning
- Integrate live dashboards for management monitoring
