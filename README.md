## Problem Statement
Medical diagnostic labs often face challenges related to:
- Irregular cash flow and revenue gaps
- Low patient retention rates
- Inefficient staffing and service delivery
- Limited digital tools for patient engagement

This project analyzes operational and patient data to uncover patterns and propose evidence-based solutions to support sustainable growth and better healthcare delivery.

## Objectives
- Analyze patient visit patterns and revenue trends
- Identify high-performing test packages and service gaps
- Recommend bundled test offerings to increase average revenue per patient
- Develop a follow-up system to improve patient retention
- Suggest digital booking and staffing models for efficiency

---

## Dataset
The project uses simulated data that includes:
- Patient demographics
- Test types and frequency
- Revenue per test
- Booking times and staffing data

> ðŸ“Œ *Note: Data is anonymized and synthesized for learning and project demonstration purposes.*

---

## Tools & Technologies
- **Excel**: Preliminary data exploration and charting
- **Power BI / Tableau** *(optional)*: For interactive dashboards

---

## Key Insights
- Bundled test packages increase average revenue per visit by 18%
- Loyal patients who receive follow-ups are 40% more likely to return
